    <description brief="The Manifold Toolkit (latest)">

    This package contains a recent version of the Manifold Toolkit
    MTK is a toolkit that provides easy mechanisms to enable arbitrary algorithms to operate on manifolds.
    The main application is the use of 3D rotations SO(3), as well as the construction of compound manifolds from arbitrary combinations of sub-manifolds.
    We also provide a refactored version of the previously released SLoM framework which implements Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt-based sparse least-squares
    optimization on manifolds and a port of MTK to Matlab (MTKM).
